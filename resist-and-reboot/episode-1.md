In this episode, we talk to the Project Coordinator of The Glass Room Project at [Tactical Tech](https://tacticaltech.org/), a Berlin-based international NGO that engages with citizens and civil-society organisations to explore the impacts of technology on society. 

In this podcast, we discuss the ways in which technology can be made a public conversation through the use of artefacts, objects and exhibitions. We explore how  these interventions can be used to help people understand the impact of data and technology in their lives. The podcast connects to discussions on the misformation edition of the Glass Room project, the ways in which Tactical Tech collaborates globally, and also how they encourage and support organizing around digital rights issues around the world.
