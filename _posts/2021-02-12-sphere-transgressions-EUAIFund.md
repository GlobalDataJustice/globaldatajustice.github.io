The Global Data Justice project is happy to announce the start of its new research initiative, entitled _Sphere transitions and transgressions during COVID-19: Challenging the tech sector's power grab in Europe_. This project is funded by the [EU AI Fund](https://europeanaifund.org/announcing-our-tech-and-covid-19-grant/), and is part of its Tech and COVID-19 theme. 

Europe is undergoing extensive political, social and economic changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Much of this upheaval is being driven by technological interventions made possible by the offerings of a multitude of digital tech and data analytics firms and can be observed all around us in the form of ‘sector creep’. 

Over the next year this project, which builds on the [_Data Justice and COVID-19: Global Perspectives_](https://globaldatajustice.org/covid-19/) book published by Meatspace Press, will research what philosopher Tamar Sharon calls [‘sector transgressions’](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10676-020-09547-x) that are occuring as a result of the pandemic. This is a phenomenon whereby firms establish themselves in one sphere of application, then use the computational infrastructure, political capital and insights they gain from it to pivot to other spheres, where they may lack domain experience and ethical understanding to operate without potential harm to the public. For instance, we have witnessed companies like Palantir, which typically works with intelligence, defence and law enforcement agencies, pursue business opportunities in the health sphere in several European countries (including [France](https://www.bfmtv.com/tech/vie-numerique/donnees-de-sante-l-ap-hp-ecarte-la-proposition-de-palantir_AN-202004170210.html), [Germany](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-01/palantir-in-talks-with-germany-france-for-virus-fighting-tool) and [the UK](https://www.ft.com/content/6f6575a8-799f-42a4-b1cc-3f7452b2166f)). Likewise, vendors specialising in security, surveillance and identity ‘solutions’ marketed for airports and other transportation sites have [pivoted](https://onezero.medium.com/clear-conquered-u-s-airports-now-it-wants-to-own-your-entire-digital-identity-15d61076e44d) to find new applications for their offerings in other spheres following a massive decline in travel during the lockdown. 

These examples show the need for a more comprehensive account of the various sphere transgressions being made possible by European countries’ pandemic responses and an analysis of the implications of these transgressions for rights and regulatory processes. This project will  use empirical research across nine European countries, namely the UK, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Romania, Hungary and Italy to investigate sphere transgressions and their implications. We are committed to working transparently and sharing our insights in openly accessible outlets, including on the Global Data Justice project website. 

As part of the project we also aim to engage with experts and stakeholders, such as civil society organisations, both to understand their insights into this phenomenon and to form a network of organisations working on the issues that may arise from it.
