### *Special Issue on Data, Law, and Decolonisation*

In this Special Issue on Data, Law and Decolonisation, the [Technology and Regulation journal](https://techreg.org/) invites contributions that analyse the emergence of law for the digital economy at a global level (in terms of digital rights discourses, laws on data sharing, data for development in international law or competing privacy regulations) from a decolonial perspective. With the emergence of different models of data governance around the world such as public data trusts, data cooperatives and models around data sovereignty, we are interested in finding ways to build a more diverse and a more global understanding of these debates We wish to study how governments, international organizations and big tech corporations influence domestic and international legal regimes and shape transnational conversations about data governance and regulation. We would also like to reflect on the role that activists and community organizations play in shaping data governance frameworks. 

Through inviting decolonial perspectives, we seek articles that reflect on how data can be regulated at a global level, while at the same time give voice to different cultures, ideologies and experiences with datafication. The Special Issue asks whether existing discourses on the intersection of data and law reflect experiences largely in the Global North, and how material engagements of the digital economy in the South can be articulated and incorporated in terms of the categories, values and norms that influence the building of laws. We would also like to explore how varied resources, capacities and access to data infrastructures, among different players in the data market, impact the ways in which they can shape and influence policy. Another aspect of interest is the tensions between state visions of data markets and technology firms, and in particular the ways in which firms differentiate between geographical regions, depending on the capacities of states to push back and regulate them. We are interested in comparative research that evaluates data governance frameworks across country contexts, and how moves towards data nationalism and data sovereignty, affect the way in which data can be governed transnationally.

In doing so, we wish to examine how the hierarchies of power in some instances between governments and corporations, governments and other governments, communities and governments, and communities and corporations shape the regulation of data. We would like to understand the implications that such power differentials have in causing harm and in creating spaces of dominance, both in terms of how data is produced and flows, and in terms of how the regulations are challenged. 

Some of the questions that the articles could cover are:
* What does a decolonisation mean when examining a law for the digital economy at a global level?
* What kinds of methods should be employed in developing data governance frameworks to account for different infrastructural capacities and socio-political contexts?
* What are the concepts, terms and cases that must be included to think critically about data and law outside the Global North?
