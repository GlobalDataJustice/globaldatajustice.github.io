title: COVID-19 and Data Justice
subtitle: Global perspectives
---
In early 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic swept the world and states of emergency were declared by one country after another, the global technology sector—already equipped with unprecedented wealth, power, and influence—mobilised to seize the opportunity. Our [new edited collection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0), published by [Meatspace Press](https://meatspacepress.com/), provides an account of what happened next, capturing the emergent conflicts and responses around the world. The essays provide a global perspective on the implications of these developments for justice: they make it possible to compare how the intersection of state and corporate power—and the way that power is targeted and exercised—confronts, and invites resistance from, civil society in countries worldwide.

This edited volume captures the technological response to the pandemic in over 30 countries, accompanied by nine thematic reflections, and reflects the unfolding of the first wave of the pandemic. 

This book can be read as a guide to the landscape of technologies deployed during the pandemic and also be used to compare individual country strategies. It will prove useful as a tool for teaching and learning in various disciplines and as a reference point for activists and analysts interested in issues of data justice.

The essays interrogate these technologies and the political, legal, and regulatory structures that determine how they are applied. In doing so,the book exposes the workings of state technological power to critical assessment and contestation

We will expand on this collection by publishing a series of additional perspectives on this website in the coming weeks and months.
