In early 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic swept the world and states of emergency were declared by one country after another, the global technology sector—already equipped with unprecedented wealth, power, and influence—mobilised to seize the opportunity.

Our [open-access edited collection](https://meatspacepress.com/go/data-justice-and-covid-19-internet-archive/), published by [Meatspace Press](https://meatspacepress.com/) in August 2020, provides an account of what happened next, capturing the emergent conflicts and responses around the world. The essays provide an international perspective on the implications of these developments for justice: they make it possible to compare how the intersection of state and corporate power—and the way that power is targeted and exercised—confronts, and invites resistance from, civil society in countries worldwide. The book was officially launched at an [event](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/data-justice-and-covid-19-book-launch-with-the-ada-lovelace-institute/) organised with the Ada Lovelace Institute. It has been [discussed](https://youtu.be/CWdCAa3J5JE) at the Oxford Internet Institue, and reviewed on [Media@LSE](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/medialse/2020/10/08/book-review-of-data-justice-and-covid-19-global-perspectives/), [Security Dialogue](https://blogs.prio.org/SecurityDialogue/2020/11/book-review-data-justice-and-covid-19-global-perspectives/), and [European Data Protection Law Review](https://doi.org/10.21552/edpl/2020/4/22).

We have initiated a new series of essays to build and expand on the book. The _**Data and Pandemic Politics**_ series, featured below, focuses on regional and country issues in more detail, following the development of the pandemic and of data and technology in response to it. Invited essays will be appearing here over the coming months; if you would like to contribute, please get in touch with us at [info@globaldatajustice.org](info@globaldatajustice.org).
