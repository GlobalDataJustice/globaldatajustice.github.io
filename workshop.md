title: Workshop on the Political Economy of Web Tracking
subtitle: May 17, 2019 at Tilburg University
---

This full-day closed workshop will take place as part of the [TILTing Perspectives conference](http://www.tilburguniversity.edu/research/institutes-and-research-groups/tilt/events/tilting-perspectives/), on May 17th. The purpose of the workshop is to scope the state of the art in web tracking research in order to understand what findings from existing studies in the technical/computer science domain can tell us about the political economy of the data market.

Participants will include scholars and practitioners working on web tracking research, tool development, privacy advocacy, and social scientific, economic or legal studies of online tracking. The main aim of the session is to scope the state of the art and to formulate a future research agenda informed by political economy concerns. The workshop will give participants an opportunity to learn about wider perspectives in web tracking studies, and provide an introduction to analytical tools and techniques often used in the study of online tracking.
