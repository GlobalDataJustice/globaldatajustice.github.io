### Shazade Jameson

I am social science researcher specialising in digital governance and smart urbanism, and I am a PhD candidate on the GDJ project. My background spans international development studies, human geography, urban sustainability, and cognitive psychology. 

I am interested in how we can have a more inclusive global conversation around data governance in the context of economic growth. In particular, my research investigates the implications of data innovation in public sector governance of smart cities. What does it mean to move towards a digital society? Currently, I am thinking about the how uncertainty and adaptation are dealt with in experimental approaches to urban development, and how data-driven decision-making reshapes our relationship to the risk society.
